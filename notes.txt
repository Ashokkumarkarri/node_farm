Implemented simple API.

we put "const data=fs.readFileSync('./dev-data/data.json','utf-8');" outside the routing cause we do not 
want our application fetch the data from the database everytime we refresh.
thats why we put this outside the routing.

By placing const data = fs.readFileSync('./dev-data/data.json', 'utf-8'); outside the routing logic, 
you ensure that the file is read only once when the server starts. 
This approach prevents the application from reading the file from the disk on every request, which can be inefficient and slow.
